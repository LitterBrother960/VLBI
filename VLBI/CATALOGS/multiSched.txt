% In this file, you can specify if you want do use the multi scheduling 
% tool. 
%
% If you use this, VieVS will run multiple schedules. Therefore VieVS
% creates new subfolders "v1", "v2", ... "vn" in your output directory. In
% these subfolders the results from the different schedules are saved. 
%  
% A "#" at the start of a line means, that you start a new schedule. After
% your "#"-Line you can specify different parameters. By default VieVS will
% use the standard parameters from the param.m file and the catalogs, but
% you can override these parameters here. Keep in mind, that you override
% this parameter ONLY FOR THIS SCHEDULE!
%  
% A "%" starts a comment
%  
% Everything under your "#"-Line is interpreted as MATLAB code. 
% In theory you can change every parameter in the "station", "twin", 
% "source" and "PARA" structures. 
%  
% If you just want to change some minor parameters you only have to write:
% "PARA.PARAMETER = 1;" (check the param.txt file for a list of parameters)
% If you want to change something in the other structures you need some 
% more knowlege of our VieVS_Sched structure fields. 
% Just write your code the same way you would add it in our *.m functions. 
%  
% Because this is interpreted as MATLAB code don't forget to put a ";" at
% the end of your expression. Also keep in mind that MATLAB normally 
% compiles code the first time you run it to enhance performance for  
% furture runs. However, because this code can change at runtime it is not 
% compiled! If ther is a syntax error, this line is ignored!

% Defining start- and end-index (use endIdx Inf to use all schedules up to the end)
